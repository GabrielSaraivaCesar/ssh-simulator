# SSH Simulator

I was rencently studing about the SSH service and I decided to create a simple simulator to understand better how it works.

This simulator is a simple implementation of the SSH service, trying to simulate how SSH handshake works and how it ensures confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.

Run the script with the following command:
```shell
$ python3 ssh_simulator.py
```
